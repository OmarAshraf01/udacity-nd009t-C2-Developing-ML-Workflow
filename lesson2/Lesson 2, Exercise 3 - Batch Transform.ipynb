    "In the last exercise, we asked you to reflect on the disadvantages of having to perform preprocessing on a local machine. In addition to those disadvantages, such as user error and hardware limitations, you may have also encountered another frustration in submitting a large amount of data to an endpoint. There may be network limitations on your end, there may be security/privacy concerns, and there might be an obvious performance advantage in parallelism that may be difficult to implement. "

All that's required of us is to give batch transform the correct directions to the data we want to submit. "
